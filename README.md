Bino Badge Generator and Verifier
This repository contains a simple, single-page web application that allows users to generate a customized "Bino Certified" business badge and verify the authenticity of an existing one by scanning its QR code. This project is built entirely with front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and uses a local JSON file to simulate a data store for verification.

Features
Badge Creation: Businesses can input their name, slogan, and logo to create a branded certification badge.

Dynamic QR Codes: A unique QR code is generated for each badge, encoding a specific partner ID for verification.

Image Download: Users can download the final badge as a PNG image, ready for use on websites or marketing materials.

QR Code Verification: The app can read a QR code from an image file and instantly verify if the associated ID is valid, confirming the badge's authenticity.

Simulated Backend: A data.json file is used to store and check partner IDs, making the application fully functional without a server.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the application's structure.

CSS3: For styling and layout.

JavaScript (ES6+): Powers all interactive functionality.

Third-party Libraries:

qrcode.js: To generate the QR codes.

html2canvas: To render the HTML badge as a downloadable image.

jsQR: To decode QR codes from uploaded images.
